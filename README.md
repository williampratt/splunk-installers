# Splunk Installer Scripts
---
Simple shell scripts to download spunk or splunkforwarder via wget, install, start it and delete the install file. There are variables at the top of the script if you want to change various things like wget url for a specific version, user to install and start splunk as, etc. Message me with any ideas / concerns / questions.


I plan to add ulimit and thp (system tuning to this as time allows)
